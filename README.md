## 1. Neural Networks

  Learn neural networks basics, and build your first network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.

  **Project:** Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

  Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

## 2. Convolutional Neural Networks

  Learn how to build convolutional networks and use them to classify images (faces, melanomas, etc.) based on patterns and objects that appear in them. Use these networks to learn data compression and image denoising.

**Project:** Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media

In the project, you will go through a machine learning design process end-to-end: performing data preprocessing and augmentation, designing your own CNN from scratch, and training and saving your best CNN model. You will also use transfer learning and compare your transfer-learned model with your from-scratch CNN.

## 3. Recurrent Neural Networks

  Build your own recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with PyTorch; perform sentiment analysis and use recurrent networks to generate new text from TV scripts.

  **Project:** Generate TV scripts

  Build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of your favorite TV show, based on old scripts.

## 4. Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model

  Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. Deployment gives you the ability to use a trained model to analyze new, user input. Build a model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.
