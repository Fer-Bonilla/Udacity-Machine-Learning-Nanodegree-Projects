# Course program

## 1. Software Engineering Fundamentals

  In this lesson, you’ll write production-level code and practice object-oriented programming, which you can integrate into machine learning projects.

  **Project:** Build a Python Package

  Build your own Python package, a skill that every software engineer should have. This exercise will not be required for you to complete this program and, as such, will not be graded.

## 2. Machine Learning in Production

  Learn how to deploy machine learning models to a production environment using Amazon SageMaker.

  **Project:** Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model

  Build and deploy a deep learning model that predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review using Amazon SageMaker. In addition, create a simple web app that uses your deployed model and accepts user input.

## 3. Machine Learning Case Studies

  Apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world tasks; explore data and deploy both built-in and custom-made Amazon SageMaker models.

  **Project:** Plagiarism Detector

  Use your advanced machine learning skills to define similarity metrics between two text documents and identify cases of plagiarism. You’ll perform feature engineering and train and deploy a custom, plagiarism-classification model using Amazon SageMaker.

## 4. Machine Learning Capstone

  In this capstone lesson, you’ll select a machine learning challenge and propose a possible solution.

  **Project:** Capstone Proposal and Project

  Define a problem you want to solve. Then, explore the relevant data, perform feature extraction and modeling steps, and develop a set of final insights. You will present the analysis and your insights in a blog post and GitHub repository. This project will serve as a demonstration of end-to-end machine learning skills that will be an important piece of your job-ready portfolio.
